      " The First Law of Motion, also known as the Law of Inertia, states that an object at rest tends to stay at rest, and an object in motion tends to stay in motion with the same speed and direction, unless acted upon by an external unbalanced force.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine a ball resting on a table (NCERT Chapter 1, Lesson 2.2). If we don't push or pull it, it stays still because there is no external force to make it move. Now, if we throw the ball, it moves with a certain speed and direction. As long as no other forces act on it, it will continue moving in that same direction (NCERT Chapter 1, Lesson 2.3).\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let's consider two balloons rubbed with a woollen cloth and brought near each other (NCERT Chapter 1, Lesson 2.6). They attract each other due to static electricity (NCERT Chapter 1, Lesson 2.5). This attraction is an external force acting on the balloons. Initially, they stay apart due to the Law of Inertia, but when we bring them closer, the force overcomes their tendency to stay still or move in their original direction, causing them to stick together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, let's consider a coin sinking in water and a bigger wooden block floating (NCERT Chapter 1, Lesson 2.4). The coin sinks because its weight is greater than the upward force exerted by the water on it, while the wooden block floats because its weight is less than the upward force of buoyancy that the water exerts on it (NCERT Chapter 1, Lesson 2.5).\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, if we throw a ball upwards, it slows down, stops momentarily, and then falls back to the ground (NCERT Chapter 1, Lesson 2.3). The forces acting on the ball are its weight pulling it downwards (gravity) and the air resistance pushing it upwards as it moves through the air. When the ball reaches its highest point (momentary stop), these two forces balance each other out. Once the ball starts falling back down, gravity again overcomes the air resistance, causing the ball to accelerate towards the ground.\n",
